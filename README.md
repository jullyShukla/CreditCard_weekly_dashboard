# Credit Card Weekly Dashboard Project
**Overview**
This repository contains the documentation for a project aimed at developing a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

**Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard that offers stakeholders insights into credit card transactions on a weekly basis. The dashboard will utilize data from CSV files containing credit card transaction data, which will be stored and processed using SQL databases. Key performance metrics and trends will be visualized and analyzed to support informed decision-making and optimization of credit card operations.

**Project Structure**
The project is organized into the following directories:

data: Contains CSV files containing credit card transaction data.
sql: Includes SQL scripts for creating tables in a SQL database, importing data from CSV files, and implementing data cleansing procedures.
power_bi: Contains the Power BI dashboard project files, including data models, visualizations, and reports.
docs: Documentation files, including the README.

**Getting Started**
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up a SQL database and import the CSV files containing credit card transaction data.
Execute the SQL scripts in the sql directory to create tables, import data, and perform data cleansing procedures.
Open the Power BI project files in the power_bi directory using Power BI Desktop.
Customize the dashboard as needed, adding additional visualizations or insights as required.
Deploy the Power BI dashboard to your preferred platform for sharing with stakeholders.
